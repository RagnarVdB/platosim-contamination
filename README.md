# PLATOSim Contamination
PLATOSim Contamination is a high level interface for working with [pytransit](https://github.com/hpparvi/PyTransit) and [PlatoSim](https://ivs-kuleuven.github.io/PlatoSim3/). The package makes it effortless to simulate planetary transits, generate theoretical lightcurves and fit transits to data, including contamination. ... was developed as part of our bachelor project 'PLATO multi-colour photometry for exoplanet candidate validation'. 

## Installation
    pip install git+...
Make sure PlatoSim3 is installed correctly.
A brief overview of the capabilities of the package is given in `examples/example.ipynb`.
